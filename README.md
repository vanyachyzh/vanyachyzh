# Hey there! üëã

My name is Ivan, and this is my GitHub portfolio. As a seasoned web developer, I love crafting awesome websites from start to finish! Whether it's building robust code bases or collaborating with a team, I'm all in. I believe in creating code that's not only resilient but also super reusable, making future projects a breeze.
Coding isn't just a job for me, it's my passion! I'm excited to join a top-notch engineering team where I can contribute to creating stellar solutions that push the boundaries of quality with every project.

Let's build something amazing together! üíª‚ú®

Below is a list of technologies I have worked with
